Please be advised that:

A counterparty that wants to terminate a contract needs to send a letter of termination via fax to (713) 646-3227
	           The termination letter needs to include:
		1.) List of contracts being terminated
		2.) Calculation of termination payment
		3.) Expectation of payments if applicable
  
A counterparty that unwinds deals does not mean a contract its null and void; the counterparty is still liable for the existing deals governed by the contract

Please forward this on to anyone who needs this information.
