Barry,

How are you? Just want to say hi. It must be a very hectic week and
stressful. With the talents of people at Enron such as yourself being the
major asset of the company, the industry recognizes that fact. I am sure
that you will do well. In the mean time, hold tight, pray, and have faith. 

Keep in touch.
