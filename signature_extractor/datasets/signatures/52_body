To whom it may concern:

Tags numbered 33079 (5mw) and 33086 (20mw) were cut for a number of hours.  

HE 08 and HE 09:
Both tags were cut and nobody informed any of the counter parties that the tags were cut until about 25minutes into the last hour of the cuts.  I initially heard of the cuts from Larry @ MEANMN and immediately called each person in the path to inform them of the cut situation.  No action was taken for these two hours.
