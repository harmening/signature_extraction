Thanks to each of you who help in the review process yesterday.  As many of you know, we found that several of the contracts that we reviewed did reconcile with the Total Exposure (in other words, the agreements were not the right ones).  Eric Moon and Russell Diamond are working with IT, Credit and Risk to access deal specific information in a way that will let us link deal numbers to contract numbers.  Thereafter we can get the right agreements and finish the process.  I will update you later today on the status.  If you have any questions, please ask.
