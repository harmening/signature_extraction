Bill:

For yet another day we seem to be having problems including all the schedules in our EPE schedule sheet.  Tag 52159 was not included (25mw schedule to LADWP).  I think part of the problem is some counterparties are not including EPMIWE as a PSE.  Fortunately, the dispatchers had the schedule and informed me of the problem.  I then called LADWP and WESCO to checkout with them.  If this did not happen we wouldn't have known what the deal was.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.
